# SeaPass
### Basic command line password manager

Work in progress

Requires OpenSSL library to be installed: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/) 

To compile and run:

1. <code>make</code>
2. <code>./seapass</code>

Note: To create an encrypted password file you must have a template <code>datafile.txt</code> similar to the one provided, and there must not be any file called <code>cryptofile</code> in the current directory.
